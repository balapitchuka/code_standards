# Python Coding Style


### PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal)
PEP 8 is a style guide that describes the coding standards for Python. It's the most popular guide within the Python community.
  
PEP 8 naming conventions:
  + class names -  CamelCase (MyClass)
  + variable names - snake_case and all lowercase (first_name)
  + function names - snake_case and all lowercase (quick_sort())
  + constants - snake_case and all uppercase (PI = 3.14159)
  + modules should have short, snake_case names and all lowercase (numpy)
  + single quotes and double quotes are treated the same (just pick one and be consistent)
